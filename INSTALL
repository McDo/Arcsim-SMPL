The provided Makefile can be used to compile the software on Linux or
Mac OS X.

You will need to have the following libraries installed:

* libboost-all-dev
* freeglut3-dev
* gfortran
* liblapacke-dev
* libpng-dev libpng++-dev
* libatlas-base-dev
* libopenblas-dev
* libjsoncpp-dev
* scons
* ctags
* sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgfortran.so.N /usr/lib/libgfortran.so if `cannot find -lgfortran`

On Linux, you should be able to get all of them through your
distribution's package manager.

On a Mac, BLAS and LAPACK already come with XCode. Get Boost, libpng,
and freeglut through MacPorts or Homebrew.

Build the dependencies inside the `dependencies/` forldor after installing the prerequisite libraries. Learn more detials from `dependencies/README_runia.md`

Finally build the program from root directory.

IMPORTANT:
On a Mac, the default GCC that ships with XCode causes OpenMP programs
to crash. If you use MacPorts, install its latest GCC and use that. If
not, get it from http://hpc.sourceforge.net/.

To compile the software, first go into the dependencies/ directory and
run 'make' to compile the required additional libraries (ALGLIB,
JsonCpp, and TAUCS). If that is successful (i.e. running 'make' again
does nothing), you can compile the simulator itself by going back to
the parent directory and running 'make'. The Makefile puts executables
in the bin/ directory. By default, it produces an optimized build,
bin/arcsim. The debug build can be compiled using 'make debug', which
produces bin/arcsimd.

Try running 'bin/arcsim simulate conf/sphere.json' to see if all is
well: you should see a square sheet hanging above a sphere, and once
you hit Space it should start simulating.
